4. Update your `.env` file

#### Option C: Your student access needs activation
1. Check your Google for Education benefits
2. Look for AI/ML specific credits or access
3. Contact your institution's IT department

### 4. Test Your Access Level
```bash
# Test your current quota
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"contents":[{"parts":[{"text":"Hello"}]}]}' \
     -X POST "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY"
```
